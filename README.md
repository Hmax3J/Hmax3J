### Hi there ! :wave:
:sunny: I'm currently living in Korea, and I aspire to become a backend developer. :smiley: <br>
After studying to become a better developer, I plan to leave my traces on GitHub. :seedling: <br>
I believe that when given a role, I approach it diligently without cutting corners. <br>
I tend to work quietly and consistently, and I want to leverage these qualities in my development work. <br>
During a movie community project, <br>
I faced a challenge when implementing the modification of user preferences, specifically changing the preferred movie genre. <br>
Upon completing this task, I noticed that returning to the user's profile page displayed a disorderly arrangement of preferred genres, <br>
and the data in the database was incorrectly stored. <br>
It took quite some time to resolve this issue, but the feeling of accomplishment and pride afterward was truly rewarding. <br>
In the future, I aim to bring this work ethic to a professional setting, diligently working towards my desired role in a company. <br>
I want to experience a sense of achievement and satisfaction in my career, <br>
:pray: much like the rewarding feeling I had after resolving the issue in my movie community project. :muscle:
